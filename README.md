Semi-Automated Refactoring of BPMN Processes.
=============================================

This repository contains the source code of a tool allowing a user to optimise a BPMN process
enhanced with time and resources.
This code is embedded in a JAR file that is executed in the backend of a NodeJS server that one
can run locally.
To use this tool, one should clone the actual repository on his machine.

Required Softwares
=============================================

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/)
*

Server setup
=============================================

* Go the ``TOOL'' folder
* Run the ``npm install'' command to install all the necessary node modules
* Go to the ``src'' folder
* Run the ``npx nodemon main.js'' command to start the server
* In case of errors, fix them
* The server should now [be running locally on port 3003](http://localhost:3003)

Tool usage
=============================================

* The user must first upload the process, and optionally its dependencies and the global information
of the system
  * BPMN file: Each task of the BPMN process must have a name, a duration, and the list of
required resources, with the following syntax: ``name (duration) <1 resource_1, 3 resource_2>''.
Examples can be found in the "EXAMPLES" folder of this project.

  * (Optional) Dependencies file: The user can upload a dependency file containing the dependencies
between tasks of the process that must be preserved by the refactoring operations. This file must
contain tuples of tasks written line per line. For example, if task ``T1'' must be executed before
task ``T2'', the following tuple should appear on a line of the dependency file: ``(T1,T2)''. If no
such file is provided, all the original dependencies between tasks of the process may be broken by
the refactoring approach. Examples can be found in the "EXAMPLES" folder of this project.

  * (Optional) Global information: The user can upload a global information file containing the
global information that the system must know in order to perform the internal computations.
This file, if provided, must contain:
    * On the first line: ``- IAT: [RealDistribution type (const, normal, exp, ...)], [first_parameter_of_the_distribution], [second_parameter_of_the_distribution]''
    * On the second line: ``- Nb instances: [number of instances required]''
    * On the third and last line: ``- Global resources: <[nb replicas of resource one] [name of resource one] ([cost of resource one]), ...>''
If not provided, these information will be automatically generated by the tool. Examples can be
found in the "EXAMPLES" folder of this project.
